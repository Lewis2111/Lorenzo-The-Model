        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am very passionate about awareness of mental health. Iâ€™m very interested in promoting in healthier decisions in the educational system, im an outgoing loving person who loves to laugh and to make others laugh especially when i notice someone having a rough day. When I left high school, one of my ideas was to become either a teacher or therapist. I love to travel and kick back with friends and family on down time. Fashion is one of my biggest pet peeves as im known for.
