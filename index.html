                About Me:
I am very passionate about the awareness of mental health and I'm very interested in promoting healthier decisions in everyday life. I'm an outgoing, loving person who loves to laugh and to make others laugh! When going to college, my dream was to become either an engineer, guidance counselor or teacher! I love to travel and be with friends and family on my down time. Fashion is my passion and everyone knows it!
